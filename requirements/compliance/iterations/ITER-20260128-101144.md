## Summary

**Last Error:** E2E run #1 timed out filling `#mtg-extra` because advanced options were still collapsed; opening the summary made the controls visible, so rerun #2 passed.

**Files Changed:**
- requirements/compliance/requirement_tracker.md
- requirements/compliance/build_tracker.md
- requirements/compliance/iterations/ITER-20260128-101144.md
- public/calculators/loans/home-loan/index.html
- public/calculators/loans/home-loan/module.js
- requirements/specs/e2e/home-loan-calculator.spec.js

**Notes:**
- Reordered the calculation pane so the button, monthly payment output, and summary stack before the advanced options drawer.
- Added a single down payment field driven by segmented buttons that toggle the label/placeholder and convert values without changing row height.
- Updated the home loan E2E spec to open the collapsed advanced panel, verify the percent label, and reuse the combined down payment input before rerunning the suite.

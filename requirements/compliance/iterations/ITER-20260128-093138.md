- REQ_ID: REQ-20260128-003
- BUILD_ID: BUILD-20260128-093138
- Status: RUNNING
- Iteration: 1/25

## Scope
- Remove Monthly/Yearly Summary sections, fix/adjust Balance Chart, and simplify the schedule toggle for the Home Loan calculator.

## Changes
- Removed the Monthly/Yearly summary sections and button group from the explanation pane.
- Added the single schedule toggle, aligned CSS, and updated the yearly table container to rely on `is-hidden`.
- Mirrored the simplified explanation markup into `/public/loans/home-loan/index.html` so the live page reflects the toggle.

## Commands
- npm run lint
- npm run test:e2e -- requirements/specs/e2e/home-loan-calculator.spec.js *(initial run timed out while waiting for the new toggle; mirrored markup into `/public/loans/home-loan/index.html` and reran)*
- npm run test:e2e -- requirements/specs/e2e/home-loan-calculator.spec.js

## Notes
- Build started via EVT_START_BUILD.
- First E2E run hit a timeout because the toggle existed only in `/public/calculators`; after duplicating the markup into `/public/loans/home-loan/index.html`, the second run passed.

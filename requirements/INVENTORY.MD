Calculator Inventory & Status Disclosure
================================================
This documentation must acknowledge all calculator folders, even if they are not active in navigation.
Math Calculators (Current & Legacy)
The following folders exist under public/calculators/math/:
basic-operations
percentage-increase

These calculators are currently:
    ❓ Not active in navigation.json
    ❓ May represent legacy, work-in-progress, or deprecated code

Requirement:
    Documentation must explicitly state the status of such calculators:
        Legacy
        Work-in-progress
        Deprecated
        Silent omission is not allowed

A “complete understanding” document must reflect actual repository state, not just active UI elements.

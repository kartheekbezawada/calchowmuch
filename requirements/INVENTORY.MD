Calculator Inventory & Status Disclosure
================================================
This documentation must acknowledge all calculator folders, even if they are not active in navigation.

Math Calculators (Current & Legacy)
The following folders exist under public/calculators/math/:

- basic
- fraction-calculator
- percentage-calculator
- percentage-increase

Status:
    - Active in navigation.json: basic, fraction-calculator, percentage-increase
    - Present in the repository but not wired into the live UI:
        - percentage-calculator (Work-in-progress / standalone)

Requirement:
    Documentation must explicitly state the status of such calculators:
        Legacy
        Work-in-progress
        Deprecated
        Silent omission is not allowed

A “complete understanding” document must reflect actual repository state, not just active UI elements.

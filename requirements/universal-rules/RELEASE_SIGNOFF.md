# Release Sign-Off Template

> **This file is a TEMPLATE only.** Do not write release evidence here.
>
> For each release, create a new file:
> `requirements/universal-rules/release-signoffs/RELEASE_SIGNOFF_{RELEASE_ID}.md`
>
> Example: `RELEASE_SIGNOFF_REL-20260214-001.md`

---

## Naming Convention

```
RELEASE_SIGNOFF_REL-YYYYMMDD-###.md
```

- `YYYYMMDD` — release date (UTC)
- `###` — sequential release number for that day (001, 002, etc.)

## Storage Location

```
requirements/universal-rules/release-signoffs/
├── RELEASE_SIGNOFF_REL-20260214-001.md
├── RELEASE_SIGNOFF_REL-20260215-001.md
└── ...
```

## Workflow

1. Copy the template sections below into a new file named `RELEASE_SIGNOFF_{RELEASE_ID}.md`
2. Fill out all sections with evidence
3. Add a summary row to `Release Sign-Off Master Table.md` linking to the sign-off file
4. Inform human: "Ready to merge"

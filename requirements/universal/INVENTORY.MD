Calculator Inventory & Status Disclosure
================================================
This documentation must acknowledge all calculator folders, even if they are not active in navigation.

See also: `requirements/universal/UI_REQUIREMENTS.MD`
Math Calculators (Current & Legacy)
The following folders exist under public/calculators/math/:
basic-operations
percentage-increase

These calculators are currently:
    - Not active in navigation.json
    - Present in the repository but not wired into the live UI
    - Classified for documentation purposes as **Work-in-progress / unverified** and **not for production use** until explicitly reclassified by maintainers

Requirement:
    Documentation must explicitly state the status of such calculators:
        Legacy
        Work-in-progress
        Deprecated
        Silent omission is not allowed

A “complete understanding” document must reflect actual repository state, not just active UI elements.

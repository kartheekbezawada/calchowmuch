# Phase 07 - Architecture requirements & documentation alignment

## Goals

- Capture UI + modular architecture requirements in a standalone document.
- Align documentation paths to the actual `requirements/` directory.
- Update the phase tracker with accurate status for Phases 01-06.

## Deliverables

- [x] Add `Architecture.md` with UI + modular architecture requirements.
- [x] Update `CLAUDE.MD` to reference `requirements/` paths and `Architecture.md`.
- [x] Update `codex.md` to reference `requirements/` paths and `Architecture.md`.
- [x] Update `README.md` to point to architecture and requirements docs.
- [x] Update `requirements/INDEX.MD` with Phases 01-06 marked complete and Phase 07 active.

## Notes

- Phase 01 requirements document was lost; tracker still marks it complete.

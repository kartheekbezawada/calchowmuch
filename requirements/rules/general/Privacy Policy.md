Privacy Policy

Effective date: 27 January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how CalcHowMuch (“we”, “us”) handles information when you use our calculators and informational pages (the “Site”). We are an independent project site and do not intend to collect personal information from you for calculator use. We use a small number of third-party services to deliver the Site and fund it through advertising.

1) What we do and do not do

We do not:

require accounts or logins to use calculators,

ask you to provide personal details (name, email, phone, address) to use calculators,

sell your personal data.

We do:

use infrastructure services (Cloudflare) to host, secure, and deliver the Site, which involves processing basic technical request data, such as IP address and device/browser information.

show ads via Google AdSense to support the Site.

2) Third-party services we use
Cloudflare (hosting, security, performance)

The Site is delivered via Cloudflare services (e.g., CDN, caching, security). Cloudflare’s privacy materials are here:
Cloudflare’s cookie information is here:

Because Cloudflare sits between your browser and the Site, it may process technical data such as IP address, request metadata, and security/performance signals to deliver and protect the Site.

Google AdSense (advertising)

We plan to display ads using Google AdSense. Google and other third-party vendors may use cookies or similar technologies to serve and measure ads, including ads based on a user’s prior visits (depending on settings/consent).
Google also provides information about cookies used for its ad products.

3) Advertising data and cookies (Google AdSense)

When ads are shown on the Site:

Third-party vendors (including Google) may place and read cookies in your browser, and/or use similar technologies such as web beacons or IP addresses to collect information in connection with ad serving and measurement.

Google states that advertising cookies can be used for purposes such as serving/rendering ads, limiting frequency, measuring effectiveness, and (where enabled) personalising ads.

Ad personalisation controls: Google provides ad controls (e.g., Ads Settings) that can affect ad personalisation.

4) Consent (EEA/UK/Switzerland)

If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, Google requires publishers using AdSense/Google advertising products to:

provide disclosures about cookies/local storage and data use, and

obtain legally valid consent where required for cookies/local storage and for the collection/sharing/use of personal data for ad personalisation.

Accordingly, where legally required, we will show a consent notice and provide choices related to advertising cookies and personalisation.

5) Analytics (site usage measurement)

We may use Cloudflare Web Analytics or Cloudflare-level reporting to understand aggregated usage (e.g., page views, high-level device/browser data) and improve performance/content.

Cloudflare states that its Web Analytics does not use client-side state such as cookies/localStorage and does not “fingerprint” individuals for analytics.

6) Calculator inputs

Calculator fields are intended for general numeric/parameter inputs. We do not intend to store calculator inputs as personal profiles.

Do not enter sensitive personal information into calculator fields. If you choose to do so, you do so at your own risk.

7) Data sharing

We do not sell personal data.

We share/allow processing only as needed to operate the Site:

Cloudflare processes technical data to deliver and protect the Site.

Google AdSense (and ad partners) may process data to serve/measure ads.

Each provider has its own privacy materials:

8) Retention

Retention depends on provider configurations and operational needs (security, abuse prevention, aggregated reporting). Cloudflare describes its approach in its privacy/GDPR materials.

9) Your choices

Use your browser controls to block/delete cookies (may impact ad display and/or site protections).

Where consent controls are shown (EEA/UK/Switzerland), you can use them to manage advertising-related choices.

Google provides ad personalisation controls (Ads Settings).

10) Updates to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the Site evolves (including changes to advertising, analytics, or infrastructure). The latest version will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.

11) Liability and “no guarantees” (privacy)

This Site is a project site operated on a best-effort basis. While we aim to minimise data collection and use privacy-focused tooling, we cannot guarantee third-party services (e.g., advertising networks and infrastructure providers) will operate without error. Nothing in this policy limits rights that cannot be limited under applicable law.

1) What this site is (and what it is not)
CalcHowMuch is a personal, independent project that publishes calculators and educational explanations to help users explore “how much” style questions (for example: costs, time, finance, and everyday maths).
The Site is provided for general information, learning, and planning. It is not a regulated service, not an advisor, and not a substitute for professional judgement.
________________________________________
2) No advice (important)
Nothing on this Site is, or should be treated as, financial advice, tax advice, legal advice, medical advice, or professional advice of any kind.
You must not rely on the Site as the sole basis for any decision that could affect your finances, health, legal position, safety, or business. If you need advice, speak to a qualified professional.
________________________________________
3) Calculator outputs are estimates only
All calculator results:
•	are estimates based on the information you enter and the assumptions described on the page,
•	may be affected by rounding, edge cases, missing inputs, and changes in external factors (e.g., rates, fees, rules),
•	may not reflect your real-world situation.
You are responsible for:
•	checking inputs are correct,
•	understanding assumptions and limitations,
•	verifying results independently before acting on them.
________________________________________
4) “As-is” project status; no warranties
The Site, calculators, and all content are provided “as is” and “as available.”
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
•	we make no guarantees that calculations will be correct, complete, up to date, or suitable for your purpose,
•	we do not guarantee continuous availability, error-free operation, or that the Site will meet your expectations.
________________________________________
5) Absolute limitation of liability (maximum allowed by law)
Your use of the Site is entirely at your own risk.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, CalcHowMuch (and its owner/operator) will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with:
•	your use of, or inability to use, the Site,
•	reliance on any calculator result, explanation, example, or content,
•	errors, omissions, interruptions, delays, bugs, or data loss,
•	any decision you make based on the Site,
•	any third-party content, services, links, ads, or tools referenced on the Site.
This includes (without limitation) direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive loss or damage, including loss of profits, revenue, savings, business, goodwill, opportunity, or data.
This style of “maximum extent permitted by law” limitation is common in website terms. 
Legal carve-out: Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability that cannot be limited or excluded under law (for example, liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, or fraud/fraudulent misrepresentation where applicable).

          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 27 January 2026</p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how CalcHowMuch ("we", "us") handles information when you
            use our calculators and informational pages (the "Site"). We are an independent project
            site and do not intend to collect personal information from you for calculator use. We
            use a small number of third-party services to deliver the Site and fund it through
            advertising.
          </p>

          <h2>1) What we do and do not do</h2>
          <p>We do not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Require accounts or logins to use calculators.</li>
            <li>Ask you to provide personal details (name, email, phone, address) to use calculators.</li>
            <li>Sell your personal data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use infrastructure services (Cloudflare) to host, secure, and deliver the Site, which
              involves processing basic technical request data, such as IP address and
              device/browser information.
            </li>
            <li>Show ads via Google AdSense to support the Site.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2) Third-party services we use</h2>
          <p><strong>Cloudflare (hosting, security, performance)</strong></p>
          <p>
            The Site is delivered via Cloudflare services (e.g., CDN, caching, security). Cloudflare's
            privacy materials are here: Cloudflare's cookie information is here:
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Cloudflare sits between your browser and the Site, it may process technical data
            such as IP address, request metadata, and security/performance signals to deliver and
            protect the Site.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Google AdSense (advertising)</strong></p>
          <p>
            We plan to display ads using Google AdSense. Google and other third-party vendors may
            use cookies or similar technologies to serve and measure ads, including ads based on a
            user's prior visits (depending on settings or consent). Google also provides information
            about cookies used for its ad products.
          </p>

          <h2>3) Advertising data and cookies (Google AdSense)</h2>
          <p>When ads are shown on the Site:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Third-party vendors (including Google) may place and read cookies in your browser,
              and/or use similar technologies such as web beacons or IP addresses to collect
              information in connection with ad serving and measurement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Google states that advertising cookies can be used for purposes such as serving or
              rendering ads, limiting frequency, measuring effectiveness, and (where enabled)
              personalising ads.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ad personalisation controls: Google provides ad controls (e.g., Ads Settings) that can
              affect ad personalisation.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4) Consent (EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h2>
          <p>
            If you are in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, Google requires publishers using
            AdSense/Google advertising products to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide disclosures about cookies/local storage and data use.</li>
            <li>
              Obtain legally valid consent where required for cookies/local storage and for the
              collection/sharing/use of personal data for ad personalisation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Accordingly, where legally required, we will show a consent notice and provide choices
            related to advertising cookies and personalisation.
          </p>

          <h2>5) Analytics (site usage measurement)</h2>
          <p>
            We may use Cloudflare Web Analytics or Cloudflare-level reporting to understand
            aggregated usage (e.g., page views, high-level device/browser data) and improve
            performance/content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloudflare states that its Web Analytics does not use client-side state such as
            cookies/localStorage and does not "fingerprint" individuals for analytics.
          </p>

          <h2>6) Calculator inputs</h2>
          <p>
            Calculator fields are intended for general numeric/parameter inputs. We do not intend to
            store calculator inputs as personal profiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not enter sensitive personal information into calculator fields. If you choose to do
            so, you do so at your own risk.
          </p>

          <h2>7) Data sharing</h2>
          <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>
          <p>We share/allow processing only as needed to operate the Site:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cloudflare processes technical data to deliver and protect the Site.</li>
            <li>Google AdSense (and ad partners) may process data to serve/measure ads.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Each provider has its own privacy materials:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cloudflare Privacy Policy:</li>
            <li>Cloudflare Cookie Policy / cookie references:</li>
            <li>Google "How Google uses cookies":</li>
            <li>Google advertising technologies:</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>8) Retention</h2>
          <p>
            Retention depends on provider configurations and operational needs (security, abuse
            prevention, aggregated reporting). Cloudflare describes its approach in its
            privacy/GDPR materials.
          </p>

          <h2>9) Your choices</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use your browser controls to block/delete cookies (may impact ad display and/or site protections).</li>
            <li>Where consent controls are shown (EEA/UK/Switzerland), you can use them to manage advertising-related choices.</li>
            <li>Google provides ad personalisation controls (Ads Settings).</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>10) Updates to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as the Site evolves (including changes to advertising,
            analytics, or infrastructure). The latest version will be posted on this page with the
            updated effective date.
          </p>

          <h2>11) Liability and "no guarantees" (privacy)</h2>
          <p>
            This Site is a project site operated on a best-effort basis. While we aim to minimise
            data collection and use privacy-focused tooling, we cannot guarantee third-party
            services (e.g., advertising networks and infrastructure providers) will operate without
            error. Nothing in this policy limits rights that cannot be limited under applicable law.

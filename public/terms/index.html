          <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <p>
            These terms govern your use of CalcHowMuch. By using this site, you agree to the terms
            described below.
          </p>

          <h2>What this site is (and what it is not)</h2>
          <p>
            CalcHowMuch is a personal, independent project that publishes calculators and
            educational explanations to help users explore "how much" style questions (for example:
            costs, time, finance, and everyday maths). The site is provided for general information,
            learning, and planning. It is not a regulated service, not an advisor, and not a
            substitute for professional judgement.
          </p>

          <h2>No advice (important)</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing on this site is, or should be treated as, financial advice, tax advice, legal
            advice, medical advice, or professional advice of any kind. You must not rely on the
            site as the sole basis for any decision that could affect your finances, health, legal
            position, safety, or business. If you need advice, speak to a qualified professional.
          </p>

          <h2>Calculator outputs are estimates only</h2>
          <p>
            All calculator results are estimates based on the information you enter and the
            assumptions described on the page. Results may be affected by rounding, edge cases,
            missing inputs, and changes in external factors (for example, rates, fees, or rules),
            and may not reflect your real-world situation.
          </p>
          <p>You are responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Checking inputs are correct.</li>
            <li>Understanding assumptions and limitations.</li>
            <li>Verifying results independently before acting on them.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>"As is" project status; no warranties</h2>
          <p>The site, calculators, and all content are provided "as is" and "as available."</p>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We make no guarantees that calculations will be correct, complete, up to date, or suitable for your purpose.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee continuous availability, error-free operation, or that the site will meet your expectations.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Absolute limitation of liability (maximum allowed by law)</h2>
          <p>Your use of the site is entirely at your own risk.</p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, CalcHowMuch (and its owner/operator)
            will not be liable for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your use of, or inability to use, the site.</li>
            <li>Reliance on any calculator result, explanation, example, or content.</li>
            <li>Errors, omissions, interruptions, delays, bugs, or data loss.</li>
            <li>Any decision you make based on the site.</li>
            <li>Any third-party content, services, links, ads, or tools referenced on the site.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This includes (without limitation) direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
            or punitive loss or damage, including loss of profits, revenue, savings, business,
            goodwill, opportunity, or data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Legal carve-out: Nothing in these terms limits or excludes liability that cannot be
            limited or excluded under law (for example, liability for death or personal injury
            caused by negligence, or fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation where applicable).
          </p>

          <h2>You are responsible for your actions</h2>
          <p>You agree that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You will not use the site for any unlawful purpose.</li>

            <li>You accept full responsibility for any actions you take based on site content.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Third-party services, hosting, analytics, and links</h2>
          <p>
            The site may use third-party infrastructure and services (for example, hosting,
            security, performance tooling, and analytics). These providers may process technical
            data to deliver and protect the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cloudflare analytics (high-level): Cloudflare's Web Analytics is described by Cloudflare

          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies in general: Cloudflare also documents that it uses cookies in some contexts to
            manage traffic and protect sites, and its cookie policy describes categories of cookies.
          </p>
          <p>If the site links to third-party websites or tools:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Those sites are not under our control.</li>
            <li>Links are provided for convenience only.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for their content, availability, or practices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Privacy and cookies</h2>
          <p>
            If a separate Privacy Policy exists on the site, it forms part of how the site is
            operated and should be read alongside these terms.
          </p>
          <p>If you are concerned about cookies or analytics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use your browser settings to block or delete cookies.</li>
            <li>You can use privacy tools or extensions at your discretion.</li>
            <li>You may choose not to use the site.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Blocking cookies or scripts may affect how some pages function.</p>

          <h2>Acceptable use rules</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to attempt to gain unauthorised access to the site or its systems,
            interfere with the site's operation (for example, load testing, scraping at scale,
            abuse, or attacks), upload or transmit malware or harmful code, bypass rate limits or
            security controls, or use the site in a way that could damage, disable, or impair it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may block, throttle, or restrict access if we believe your usage threatens the site,
            other users, or infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            Unless stated otherwise, the site's text, design, layout, branding, calculator pages,
            explanatory content, original code, and logic are owned by CalcHowMuch and protected by
            applicable intellectual property laws.
          </p>
          <p>You may:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the site for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
            <li>Share links to pages.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Copy, reproduce, republish, or distribute substantial portions of the site content or code.</li>
            <li>Create derivative works from the site content or code.</li>
            <li>Use site branding in a way that implies endorsement.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Permission is required for any use beyond the allowances above.</p>

          <h2>User content (if ever added)</h2>
          <p>
            If the site later allows user submissions (comments, feedback forms, uploads), you
            agree that you own or have rights to what you submit, you do not submit unlawful or
            harmful content, and you grant the site a licence to display or use that content for
            operating and improving the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            If user content features do not exist yet, this section simply reserves the rule for
            future functionality.
          </p>

          <h2>Changes to the site and these terms</h2>
          <p>The site may change at any time, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding or removing calculators.</li>
            <li>Changing formulas, assumptions, or explanations.</li>
            <li>Altering design and navigation.</li>
            <li>Introducing or removing features (including ads or affiliate links).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may update these terms as the site evolves. Continued use after changes means you
            accept the updated terms.
          </p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate access to the site at any time (for example, to protect the
            site, comply with law, or prevent abuse). The limitation of liability and intellectual
            property sections continue to apply after termination.
          </p>

          <h2>Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are intended to be governed by the laws of England and Wales, and disputes
            are intended to be handled by the courts of England and Wales, unless mandatory local
            consumer laws in your jurisdiction require otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>

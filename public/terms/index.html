          <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
          <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 27 January 2026</p>
          <p>
            These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of CalcHowMuch
            (the "Site"). By using the Site, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not
            use the Site.
          </p>

          <h2>1) What the Site is</h2>
          <p>
            CalcHowMuch is an independent project site that provides calculators and explanatory
            content for general informational and educational purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Site may evolve frequently. Features, formulas, assumptions, pages, and outputs may
            change or be removed at any time without notice.
          </p>

          <h2>2) No professional advice</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing on this Site constitutes (or is intended to constitute) professional advice of
            any kind, including financial, tax, legal, medical, or investment advice. You must
            obtain professional advice where appropriate.
          </p>

          <h2>3) Calculator results are estimates only</h2>
          <p>All calculator outputs are estimates based on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the inputs you provide,</li>
            <li>the assumptions and limitations described on the page (if any),</li>
            <li>rounding and implementation details.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>verifying inputs and outputs,</li>
            <li>checking results independently before acting,</li>
            <li>ensuring the calculator is appropriate for your situation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4) Experimental / "as-is" nature</h2>
          <p>
            The Site and all content (including calculators, explanations, and outputs) are provided
            "as is" and "as available." We do not promise the Site is error-free, accurate,
            complete, current, or uninterrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties (express or implied),
            including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement.
          </p>

          <h2>5) No liability (maximum extent permitted by law)</h2>
          <p>You use the Site entirely at your own risk.</p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, CalcHowMuch and its owner/operator
            will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from or related to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>your use of (or inability to use) the Site,</li>
            <li>reliance on any calculator output or content,</li>
            <li>mistakes, bugs, downtime, delays, or interruptions,</li>
            <li>data loss, security incidents, or unauthorised access,</li>
            <li>decisions or actions you take based on the Site,</li>
            <li>third-party services (including advertising and analytics providers) used by the Site.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This includes any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
            loss or damage (including loss of profits, revenue, savings, opportunity, goodwill, or
            data).
          </p>
          <p>
            Legal carve-out: Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded under
            law (for example, certain liabilities for death/personal injury caused by negligence, or
            fraud/fraudulent misrepresentation where applicable).
          </p>

          <h2>6) Advertising (Google AdSense) and third-party ad technology</h2>
          <p>
            To help support the Site, we may display ads, including via Google AdSense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google's AdSense publisher guidance requires disclosures that third-party vendors
            (including Google) may use cookies and that Google's advertising cookies may be used to
            serve ads based on prior visits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google also documents how cookies are used in advertising and measurement contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            No endorsement: Ads are provided by third parties. We do not control, endorse, or
            guarantee any advertised products or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad availability: We do not guarantee that ads will display, that ad content will be
            suitable for all audiences, or that ad systems will be uninterrupted.
          </p>

          <h2>7) Consent requirements (EEA/UK/Switzerland) and consent notices</h2>
          <p>
            If you are located in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, Google's EU user consent
            requirements may apply when ads (especially personalised ads) are served. Google
            describes requirements to make disclosures and obtain consent where legally required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google also states that, in certain cases (e.g., EEA/UK/Switzerland), a Google-certified
            Consent Management Platform (CMP) integrated with the TCF is required for serving
            personalised ads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accordingly, we may display a consent notice and offer choices related to advertising
            cookies and personalisation where required.
          </p>

          <h2>8) Privacy, cookies, and third-party services (Cloudflare)</h2>
          <p>
            The Site uses Cloudflare for delivery, performance, and security (e.g., CDN, caching,
            and protection). Cloudflare's Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy are available here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Cloudflare sits between your browser and the Site, Cloudflare may process
            technical request data (e.g., IP address, request metadata, and security/performance
            signals) to deliver and protect the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your use of the Site is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how data is
            handled, including advertising and infrastructure processing.
          </p>

          <h2>9) External links and third-party content</h2>
          <p>
            The Site may include links to third-party websites or resources. These are provided for
            convenience only. We are not responsible for third-party content, availability,
            accuracy, or policies.
          </p>

          <h2>10) Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>misuse the Site, attempt unauthorised access, or disrupt normal operation,</li>
            <li>scrape the Site at scale or overload it (including automated traffic that harms availability),</li>
            <li>introduce malware, harmful code, or attempt to bypass security controls,</li>
            <li>use the Site for unlawful purposes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may restrict or block access if we believe usage threatens the Site, other users, or
            infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2>11) Intellectual property</h2>
          <p>
            Unless stated otherwise, the Site's content, design, branding, and original calculator
            logic/code are owned by CalcHowMuch and protected by applicable intellectual property
            laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may share links to pages. You may not reproduce, republish, distribute, or create
            derivative works from substantial portions of the Site without permission.
          </p>

          <h2>12) Indemnity</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless
            CalcHowMuch and its owner/operator from claims, liabilities, damages, costs, and
            expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your misuse of the Site or
            your breach of these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>13) Changes to the Site and these Terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may update the Site and these Terms at any time. Continued use after changes means
            you accept the updated Terms.
          </p>

          <h2>14) Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and disputes will be subject
            to the courts of England and Wales, except where mandatory local consumer laws require
            otherwise.

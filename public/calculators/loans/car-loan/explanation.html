  <h2>How this car loan calculator works</h2>
  <p>
    The calculator combines your price, trade-in, fees, and sales tax to estimate the amount you
    finance. It then applies a standard amortization formula to compute monthly payments and the
    year-by-year balance.
  </p>

  <h2>Car loan formula</h2>
  <p>
    Amount financed = vehicle price - down payment - trade-in + fees + sales tax
  </p>
  <p>
    Monthly payment is based on the financed amount, APR, and loan term using a fixed-rate
    amortization schedule.
  </p>

  <h2>Inputs and assumptions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vehicle price, down payment (amount or percent), and trade-in value.</li>
    <li>Dealer fees and sales tax percentage.</li>
    <li>APR and loan term in years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Results are estimates. Tax rules and fees vary by location and lender, so use your lender's
    final disclosures for exact numbers.
  </p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>How is the amount financed calculated?</strong></p>
    <p>
      It is the vehicle price minus down payment and trade-in, plus dealer fees and sales tax.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>Does a larger down payment reduce monthly payments?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Yes. A larger down payment lowers the amount financed, which reduces monthly payment and
      total interest.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>What does total cost include?</strong></p>
    <p>Total cost equals all monthly payments plus your down payment for the vehicle.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <p><strong>How does sales tax affect the loan?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Sales tax increases the amount financed, which raises both monthly payment and total
      interest.

  This estimate assumes a fixed monthly payment applied to your balance at the
  current APR. Each month, interest is added first, and then your payment reduces
  the remaining balance.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monthly rate:</strong> APR divided by 12.</li>
  <li><strong>Payoff time:</strong> How many months it takes for the balance to reach zero.</li>
  <li><strong>Total interest:</strong> The amount paid above the original balance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Increase the monthly payment to shorten the payoff timeline and reduce interest.

    <h3>What Is a Derivative?</h3>
    <p>
      The derivative of a function measures the rate at which the function's value changes with respect to changes in its input.
      Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative of f(x) with respect to x is denoted as f'(x), df/dx, or dy/dx.

    <h3>Differentiation Rules</h3>
    <h4>Power Rule</h4>
    <p>For f(x) = x^n: f'(x) = n·x^(n-1)</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If f(x) = x³, then f'(x) = 3x²</p>

    <h4>Constant Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = c (constant): f'(x) = 0</p>

    <h4>Constant Multiple Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = c·g(x): f'(x) = c·g'(x)</p>

    <h4>Sum/Difference Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = g(x) ± h(x): f'(x) = g'(x) ± h'(x)</p>

    <h4>Product Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = g(x)·h(x): f'(x) = g'(x)·h(x) + g(x)·h'(x)</p>
    <p><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> (first)' · second + first · (second)'</p>

    <h4>Quotient Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = g(x)/h(x): f'(x) = [g'(x)·h(x) - g(x)·h'(x)] / [h(x)]²</p>
    <p><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> (low d-high - high d-low) / (low)²</p>

    <h4>Chain Rule</h4>
    <p>If f(x) = g(h(x)): f'(x) = g'(h(x))·h'(x)</p>
    <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Derivative of outer function × derivative of inner function</p>

    <h3>Common Derivatives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>d/dx(sin x) = cos x</li>
      <li>d/dx(cos x) = -sin x</li>
      <li>d/dx(tan x) = sec² x</li>
      <li>d/dx(e^x) = e^x</li>
      <li>d/dx(ln x) = 1/x</li>
      <li>d/dx(a^x) = a^x · ln a</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Higher-Order Derivatives</h3>
    <p>
      The second derivative f''(x) is the derivative of the first derivative. It measures the rate of change of the rate of change,
      indicating how the slope is changing. This is useful for determining concavity and inflection points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher-order derivatives (f''', f⁽⁴⁾, etc.) continue this pattern.

    <h3>Worked Example</h3>
    <p><strong>Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x⁴ - 2x² + 5x - 1</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Apply power rule to each term:
        <ul>
          <li>d/dx(3x⁴) = 3·4x³ = 12x³</li>
          <li>d/dx(-2x²) = -2·2x = -4x</li>
          <li>d/dx(5x) = 5</li>
          <li>d/dx(-1) = 0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Combine using sum rule: f'(x) = 12x³ - 4x + 5</li>

      <li>Incorrectly applying the product rule (must use both terms)</li>
      <li>Sign errors in the quotient rule</li>
      <li>Treating constants as variables or vice versa</li>

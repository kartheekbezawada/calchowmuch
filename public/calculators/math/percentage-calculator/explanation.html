<h3>Percentage Increase</h3>
<p>
  Percentage increase shows how much a value has grown relative to its original amount.
  It's calculated by finding the difference between new and original, dividing by the original,
  and multiplying by 100.
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 80 → 100</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increase amount: 100 - 80 = 20</li>
  <li>Percentage increase: (20 ÷ 80) × 100 = 25%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Percentage Decrease</h3>
<p>
  Percentage decrease measures how much a value has fallen relative to where it started.
  The calculation is the same as increase, but the result is negative (or shown as a decrease).
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 100 → 75</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decrease amount: 100 - 75 = 25</li>
  <li>Percentage decrease: (25 ÷ 100) × 100 = 25%</li>
</ul>

<h3>What % of what</h3>
<p>
  This mode finds what percentage one number (the part) is of another number (the whole).
  Divide the part by the whole and multiply by 100.
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> 25 is what % of 200?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calculation: (25 ÷ 200) × 100 = 12.5%</li>
</ul>
<p class="helper">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If the whole value is 0, the calculation is undefined (cannot divide by zero).
</p>

<h3>What is X% of Y</h3>
<p>
  This mode calculates a specific percentage of a given value. Multiply the base value
  by the percentage and divide by 100.
</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> What is 15% of 80?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Calculation: (15 ÷ 100) × 80 = 12</li>
</ul>

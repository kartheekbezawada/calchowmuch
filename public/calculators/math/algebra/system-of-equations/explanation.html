  <h3>What Is a System of Linear Equations?</h3>
  <p>
    A system of linear equations is a set of two or more equations that share variables. Solving
    the system means finding values that satisfy every equation at the same time.

  <h3>Solution Types</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unique solution:</strong> Lines (or planes) intersect at one point.</li>
    <li><strong>No solution:</strong> Lines are parallel or planes do not intersect.</li>
    <li><strong>Infinite solutions:</strong> The equations represent the same line or plane.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Methods Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Elimination:</strong> Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable.</li>
    <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> Solve one equation for a variable and substitute.</li>
    <li><strong>Matrix / Cramer's Rule:</strong> Use determinants to solve for variables.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2×2 System Example</h3>
  <p>For the system:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 1rem">x + 2y = 5</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 1rem">3x + 4y = 11</p>
  <p>
    The determinant is 1×4 - 2×3 = -2. Using Cramer's rule gives x = 1 and y = 2.

  <h3>3×3 System Notes</h3>
  <p>
    For 3×3 systems, Cramer's rule uses determinants of 3×3 matrices. If the main determinant is
    zero, there is no unique solution.

  <h3>Graphing Insight</h3>
  <p>
    For 2×2 systems, each equation is a line. The intersection point on the graph is the solution.

  <h3>Natural Logarithm Deep Dive</h3>
  <p>
    The natural logarithm is the inverse of the exponential function with base e (~2.718). Use this tool to
    calculate ln(x) for any positive x, observe how the calculation changes with more precision, and
    watch the red highlight trace climb along the log curve.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ln(x) satisfies e^{ln(x)} = x, illustrating how exponentials and logarithms undo each other.</li>
    <li>The curve grows slowly and has a vertical asymptote at x = 0; the graph pane places the current value in context.</li>
    <li>You can enter values less than 1 to see negative outputs, and the helper text enforces the x > 0 constraint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Exponential Equation Workflows</h3>
  <p>
    Translate expressions such as 2^(x + 3) = 32 into logarithmic form to isolate x. Use the multiplier and shift fields to handle more complex
    forms like a^(m·x + c) = target.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The tool solves for x = (log_b(target) - c) / m and highlights the intersection point on the exponential curve.</li>
    <li>If the multiplier is zero or the base is invalid, the calculator prompts you to choose new parameters.</li>
    <li>The graph gives visual confirmation that the computed x lands on the target height on the exponential surface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Common and Custom Base Logarithms</h3>
  <p>
    Use this calculator to switch between base 10, base 2, e, or any positive base. The tool also shows how to translate
    the result to the base-10 scale so you can compare different formulations side-by-side.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The change-of-base formula uses ln(x)/ln(base), which is shown explicitly in the change-of-base row.</li>
    <li>Use the custom base input when exploring non-standard bases like 5 or π.</li>
    <li>The graph highlights the current argument on the selected logarithmic curve.</li>
  </ul>

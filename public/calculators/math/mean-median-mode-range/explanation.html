  <h3>What Are Mean, Median, Mode, and Range?</h3>
  <p>
    These are the four fundamental measures used to describe a dataset:
    three measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and one measure
    of spread (range).

  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average - sum of all values divided by the count.</li>
    <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is sorted. For even counts, it's the average of the two middle values.</li>
    <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The value that appears most frequently. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the maximum and minimum values.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Formulas</h3>
  <p><strong>Mean:</strong> Sum of values / Count of values</p>
  <p><strong>Median:</strong> Middle value (or average of two middle values)</p>
  <p><strong>Mode:</strong> Most frequent value(s)</p>
  <p><strong>Range:</strong> Maximum - Minimum</p>

  <h3>Worked Example</h3>
  <p>Using the default dataset: 12, 15, 18, 22, 15, 25, 18, 15</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Count:</strong> n = 8</li>
    <li><strong>Mean:</strong> (12 + 15 + 18 + 22 + 15 + 25 + 18 + 15) / 8 = 140 / 8 = 17.5</li>
    <li><strong>Median:</strong> Sorted: 12, 15, 15, 15, 18, 18, 22, 25
      <br>Middle values (4th and 5th): 15 and 18
      <br>Median = (15 + 18) / 2 = 16.5</li>
    <li><strong>Mode:</strong> 15 appears 3 times (most frequent) → Mode = 15</li>
    <li><strong>Min:</strong> 12</li>
    <li><strong>Max:</strong> 25</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 25 - 12 = 13</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>When to Use Each Measure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Best for symmetric distributions without outliers. Most commonly used average.</li>
    <li><strong>Median:</strong> Better for skewed data or when outliers are present. Represents the "typical" value.</li>
    <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Useful for categorical data or finding the most common occurrence.</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> Quick measure of spread, but sensitive to outliers.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Mode Special Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No mode:</strong> When all values appear with equal frequency (each appears once).</li>
    <li><strong>Unimodal:</strong> One value appears more frequently than others.</li>
    <li><strong>Bimodal:</strong> Two values tie for the highest frequency.</li>
    <li><strong>Multimodal:</strong> Three or more values share the highest frequency.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Edge Cases and Validation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Dataset must contain at least one valid number.</li>
    <li>Non-numeric values are rejected with an error message.</li>
    <li>Single value: mean = median = the value, range = 0, no mode.</li>
    <li>Results are formatted to 4 decimal places.</li>
  </ul>

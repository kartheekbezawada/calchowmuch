  <h3>Inverse Trigonometric Functions</h3>
  <p>
    Inverse trig functions undo sine, cosine, and tangent. They answer the question:
    "Which angle gives this value?" Each inverse has a restricted principal range.

  <h3>Principal Ranges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>arcsin(x) returns angles from -90 to 90 degrees.</li>
    <li>arccos(x) returns angles from 0 to 180 degrees.</li>
    <li>arctan(x) returns angles from -90 to 90 degrees (excluding the endpoints).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>All Solutions</h3>
  <p>
    Because trig functions are periodic, there are infinitely many solutions. The calculator
    lists all solutions within a custom interval so you can match real-world constraints.

  <h3>Domain Restrictions</h3>
  <p>
    arcsin and arccos are only defined for inputs between -1 and 1. If the value lies
    outside that range, no real angle exists.
  </p>

  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <p>
    Inverse trig is used to find angles from measured ratios in surveying, robotics,
    and signal processing. Interval selection helps align solutions with physical limits.

  <h3>Triangle Notation</h3>
  <p>
    Sides a, b, and c are opposite angles A, B, and C. Angles always sum to 180 degrees.
    The solver uses this convention to compute the missing values.

  <h3>Law of Sines</h3>
  <p>
    Use the Law of Sines when you know a side-angle pair:
    a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). It is best for ASA, AAS, or SSA inputs.

  <h3>Law of Cosines</h3>
  <p>
    Use the Law of Cosines for SAS or SSS:
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C). This finds the missing side or angle directly.

  <h3>SSA Ambiguous Case</h3>
  <p>
    SSA can create two valid triangles because a given side length can swing to two
    possible angles. The calculator reports both solutions when they exist.

  <h3>Practical Uses</h3>
  <p>
    Triangle solving is used in surveying, navigation, architecture, and physics when
    distances or angles are partially known. The diagram helps confirm proportions.

  <h3>Unit Circle Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. Every angle corresponds
    to a point (x, y) on the circle where x = cos(angle) and y = sin(angle). This makes the
    unit circle the most direct way to visualize trigonometric values.

  <h3>Quadrants and Signs</h3>
  <p>
    Quadrants determine the sign of sine and cosine: Quadrant I (+,+), Quadrant II (-,+),
    Quadrant III (-,-), Quadrant IV (+,-). Tangent follows the sign of sin/cos.

  <h3>Reference Angles</h3>
  <p>
    A reference angle is the acute angle between the terminal side and the x-axis. It helps
    match any angle to a special triangle so you can recover exact values.

  <h3>Special Angles</h3>
  <p>
    The angles 0, 30, 45, 60, 90 (and their quadrant reflections) have exact values like
    1/2, sqrt(2)/2, and sqrt(3)/2. The calculator shows both exact and decimal values.

  <h3>SOHCAHTOA Reminder</h3>
  <p>
    In right triangles: sin = opposite/hypotenuse, cos = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan =
    opposite/adjacent. The unit circle makes the hypotenuse 1, so sin and cos are the
    y- and x-coordinates directly.

  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <p>
    Unit circle values appear in physics (waves), engineering (rotations), navigation, and
    computer graphics. Memorizing special angles speeds up many real-world calculations.

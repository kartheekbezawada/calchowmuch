  <h3>Law of Sines</h3>
  <p>
    The Law of Sines connects side-angle pairs:
    a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). Use it when you know two angles and one side
    (ASA/AAS) or a side-angle pair plus another side (SSA).

  <h3>Law of Cosines</h3>
  <p>
    The Law of Cosines generalizes the Pythagorean theorem:
    c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C). It is ideal for SSS or SAS triangles.

  <h3>Choosing the Right Law</h3>
  <p>
    Auto detection checks your inputs and picks the law that fits. You can override
    the method if you know which one applies.

  <h3>Area Formulas</h3>
  <p>
    Once all sides are known, use Heron's formula. If you know two sides and the
    included angle, use area = 1/2 ab sin(C).

  <h3>Real-World Examples</h3>
  <p>
    These laws power navigation bearings, triangulation in surveying, and distance
    estimation in engineering projects.

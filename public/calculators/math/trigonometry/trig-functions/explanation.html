  <h3>Six Trigonometric Functions</h3>
  <p>
    The core functions are sin, cos, and tan. Their reciprocals are sec, csc, and cot.
    These functions model waves, rotations, and periodic motion.

  <h3>Exact Values</h3>
  <p>
    Special angles like 30, 45, and 60 degrees have exact values. The calculator shows
    both the exact forms (like sqrt(3)/2) and decimal approximations.

  <h3>Key Identities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1</li>
    <li>tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x)</li>
    <li>sec(x) = 1 / cos(x), csc(x) = 1 / sin(x), cot(x) = cos(x) / sin(x)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Graph Interpretation</h3>
  <p>
    Amplitude controls the height of the wave, while period stretches the horizontal length
    of one cycle. For tan, sec, csc, and cot, vertical asymptotes appear where the functions
    are undefined.

  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <p>
    Trig functions appear in electrical engineering, sound synthesis, structural analysis,
    and orbital mechanics. Adjusting amplitude and period mirrors real-world parameters.

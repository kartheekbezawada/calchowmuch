  <h3>What is Probability?</h3>
  <p>
    Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0
    (impossible) and 1 (certain), or equivalently 0% to 100%.

  <h3>Operations Available</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Single Event P(A):</strong> The basic probability of event A.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>AND (Independent):</strong> The probability of both A and B occurring when they are
      independent.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>OR (Combined Events):</strong> The probability of at least one of A or B occurring,
      with optional overlap input.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Conditional:</strong> P(A|B) and P(B|A) from overlap and base rates.</li>
    <li><strong>Bayes:</strong> Update P(A|B) using P(B|A), P(A), and P(B).</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Binomial probability and normal approximation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Input Definitions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Favorable / Total:</strong> Used for single-event probability.</li>
    <li><strong>P(A):</strong> The probability of event A occurring, as a percentage (0-100%).</li>
    <li>
      <strong>P(B):</strong> The probability of event B occurring, as a percentage (0-100%). Only
      needed for AND/OR/Conditional/Bayes operations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>P(A and B):</strong> The overlap between events (used for OR and Conditional).</li>
    <li><strong>P(B|A):</strong> The probability of B given A (Bayes mode).</li>
    <li><strong>n, k, p:</strong> Binomial trials, successes, and success probability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Formulas</h3>
  <p><strong>Single Event:</strong> P(E) = favorable / total</p>
  <p><strong>AND (Independent):</strong> P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</p>
  <p><strong>OR (Combined):</strong> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</p>
  <p><strong>Conditional:</strong> P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)</p>
  <p><strong>Bayes:</strong> P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)</p>
  <p><strong>Binomial:</strong> P(X = k) = C(n, k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)</p>

  <h3>Worked Example (AND)</h3>
  <p>Using defaults: P(A) = 30%, P(B) = 50%</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Convert to decimals: P(A) = 0.30, P(B) = 0.50</li>
    <li>Apply formula: P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)</li>
    <li>Calculate: 0.30 × 0.50 = 0.15</li>
    <li>Result: 0.15 or 15%</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is a 15% chance that both events occur.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Worked Example (OR)</h3>
  <p>Using: P(A) = 30%, P(B) = 50%</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Convert to decimals: P(A) = 0.30, P(B) = 0.50</li>
    <li>Apply formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) × P(B)</li>
    <li>Calculate: 0.30 + 0.50 - (0.30 × 0.50) = 0.80 - 0.15 = 0.65</li>
    <li>Result: 0.65 or 65%</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is a 65% chance that at least one event occurs.</p>

  <h3>Important Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Independence:</strong> These formulas assume events are independent (one event doesn't
      affect the other).
    </li>
    <li>Conditional and Bayes modes cover dependent event relationships.</li>
    <li>The OR formula subtracts overlap to avoid double-counting.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Edge Cases and Validation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All probabilities must be between 0% and 100%.</li>
    <li>P(A) = 0% means the event never occurs.</li>
    <li>P(A) = 100% means the event always occurs.</li>
    <li>Results are shown as both decimal and percentage.</li>
  </ul>

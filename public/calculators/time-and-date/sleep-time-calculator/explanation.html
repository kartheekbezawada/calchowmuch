  <h2>What is a Sleep Time Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Sleep Time Calculator suggests bedtimes or wake-up times that align with typical sleep
    cycles. It helps you aim to wake up at the end of a cycle, which can feel easier than waking
    in the middle of deep sleep.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Sleep Time Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>
    Most people move through sleep in repeating cycles that average about 90 minutes. The
    calculator uses 90-minute cycles and adds about 15 minutes to allow time to fall asleep.
  </p>
  <p>• If you choose a wake-up time, it works backwards to suggest bedtimes.</p>
  <p>• If you choose a fall-asleep time, it works forwards to suggest wake-up times.</p>

  <h2>Best Time to Sleep and Wake Up (Examples)</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to wake up at 6:00 AM, you may feel better waking after 4, 5, or 6 full cycles.
    That's why the calculator shows several options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: If you fall asleep at 11:30 PM, your wake-up options are roughly 6:45 AM (4 cycles),
    8:15 AM (5 cycles), or 9:45 AM (6 cycles).
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator uses averages:</p>
  <p>• Sleep cycle length is assumed to be 90 minutes (real cycles can vary).</p>
  <p>• Time to fall asleep is assumed to be 15 minutes.</p>
  <p>
    Results are general estimates and are not medical advice. If you have persistent sleep
    problems, consider speaking with a healthcare professional.

  <div class="sleep-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Is 6 hours of sleep enough?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Six hours is roughly 4 cycles. Some people manage short-term, but many perform better with
      7+ hours consistently.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="sleep-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Why are multiple sleep times shown?</strong></p>
    <p>
      The calculator shows options for 4, 5, and 6 cycles so you can choose a schedule that fits
      your day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="sleep-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Why might I still feel tired after following the suggestions?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cycle length varies by person and by night, and factors like stress, caffeine, sleep debt,
      or sleep disorders can affect how rested you feel.

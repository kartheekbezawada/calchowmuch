  <h2>What is a Nap Time Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Nap Time Calculator helps you choose a wake-up time based on when you start your nap and
    the type of nap you want. If you start at <span data-placeholder="start-time">{START_TIME}</span>
    and choose <span data-placeholder="nap-type">{NAP_TYPE}</span>, this calculator suggests
    waking up at <span data-placeholder="wake-time">{WAKE_TIME}</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Quick Naps (10–20 minutes)</h2>
  <p>
    Quick naps are short and focused. They are often used when you want a fast reset without
    feeling heavy or groggy afterward.
  </p>
  <p>Pros</p>
  <p>Fast boost in alertness</p>
  <p>Easy to fit into a busy day</p>
  <p>Lower chance of waking up feeling sluggish</p>
  <p>Cons</p>
  <p>Short naps may not feel "restful" if you are very tired</p>
  <p>Benefits can be brief if you are sleep-deprived</p>

  <h2>Power Naps (25–30 minutes)</h2>
  <p>
    Power naps are a common middle-ground. They are long enough to feel restorative but short
    enough to avoid a deep, hard-to-wake phase for many people.
  </p>
  <p>Pros</p>
  <p>Stronger refresh than a very short nap</p>
  <p>Often improves focus and mood</p>
  <p>Still relatively easy to schedule</p>
  <p>Cons</p>
  <p>Some people may still feel groggy if they wake at the wrong moment</p>
  <p>Can affect nighttime sleep if taken too late in the day</p>

  <h2>Afternoon Naps (60–90 minutes)</h2>
  <p>
    Afternoon naps are longer naps typically taken when you have more time. They can feel more
    like a full recharge, but they also come with a higher chance of waking up groggy.
  </p>
  <p>Pros</p>
  <p>More recovery than shorter naps</p>
  <p>Can feel like a full reset</p>
  <p>Useful after a very early morning or poor sleep</p>
  <p>Cons</p>
  <p>Higher chance of sleep inertia (waking up groggy)</p>
  <p>More likely to interfere with nighttime sleep, especially if taken late</p>

  <h2>When to Use a Wake Buffer</h2>
  <p>
    A wake buffer adds extra minutes after your nap time so you can wake up gradually. A small
    buffer can help you sit up, drink water, and get oriented before you need to perform a task.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Uses fixed nap durations for simplicity</p>
  <p>Uses your local browser time for "now"</p>
  <p>Does not diagnose sleep problems or provide medical advice</p>
  <p>Is a general planning tool and results may feel different for different people</p>

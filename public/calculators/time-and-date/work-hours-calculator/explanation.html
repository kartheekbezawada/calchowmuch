  <h2>What is a Work Hours Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Work Hours Calculator helps you measure the time you worked between a start time and an end time. It can subtract unpaid breaks and show your total as both hours and minutes and as decimal hours.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Decimal Hours Matter</h2>
  <p>
    Some timesheets and payroll systems use decimal hours. For example, 7 hours 30 minutes is 7.50 hours. This calculator shows both formats so you can copy the one you need.
  </p>

  <h2>Breaks and Unpaid Time</h2>
  <p>
    If you take an unpaid break, your paid time is usually your shift length minus the break. This calculator subtracts your selected break minutes from your total.
  </p>

  <h2>Night Shifts (Ends Next Day)</h2>
  <p>
    If your shift ends after midnight, your end time can look earlier than your start time. Use the "Ends next day" option so the calculator treats the end time as the next calendar day.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>
    If you work 09:00 to 17:30 with a <span data-placeholder="break-minutes">30</span> minute unpaid break, your total worked time is
    <span data-placeholder="total-hhmm">8:00</span>, which is <span data-placeholder="total-decimal">8.00</span> hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you work 22:00 to 06:00 and it ends after midnight, enable "Ends next day" to calculate 8:00 hours correctly.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Works with time-of-day inputs and does not require dates</p>
  <p>Subtracts unpaid breaks that you select</p>
  <p>Does not calculate pay, overtime rules, taxes, or legal compliance requirements</p>
  <p>Is a general timesheet helper and may not match every employer's rounding policy</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="work-hours-faq-item">

  <div class="work-hours-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Why do I see both HH:MM and decimal hours?</strong></p>
    <p>Different systems use different formats. HH:MM is easier to read, while decimal hours are often used for payroll.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="work-hours-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Does it round time?</strong></p>
    <p>No. It uses the exact times you enter. If your employer rounds to the nearest 5, 10, or 15 minutes, you should apply that policy separately.</p>

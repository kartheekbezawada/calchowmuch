  <h2>What is an Overtime Hours Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    An Overtime Hours Calculator helps you measure how many hours you worked and split them into
    regular hours and overtime hours. Your results show Total worked
    <span data-placeholder="total-hhmm">—</span>, Regular hours
    <span data-placeholder="regular-hhmm">—</span>, and Overtime hours
    <span data-placeholder="ot-hhmm">—</span> based on the overtime rule you selected.
  </p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use This Calculator</h2>
  <p>Choose a mode: Single Shift, Split Shift, or Weekly Shift.</p>
  <p>Enter your start and end times. If your shift ends after midnight, enable “Ends next day.”</p>
  <p>Enter unpaid break minutes if needed.</p>
  <p>Choose an overtime rule: Daily, Weekly, or Daily + Weekly.</p>
  <p>Set your regular limits (daily and/or weekly).</p>
  <p>(Optional) Enable night hours tracking to classify night hours and night overtime.</p>
  <p>Review the summary table and the compact results.</p>

  <h2 id="weekly-mode">Weekly Mode for Different Work Cycles</h2>
  <p>
    Not everyone uses a Monday-to-Sunday week. Weekly mode lets you pick a week start day such as
    Sunday-to-Saturday or Friday-to-Thursday. Choose your week start day and a week start date to
    label each day with the correct date, then enter the shifts for that 7-day cycle.
  </p>

  <h2 id="overtime-rules">Overtime Rules Explained (Daily vs Weekly)</h2>
  <p>
    Different workplaces use different overtime policies. Some count overtime after a certain
    number of hours in a day. Others count overtime after a certain number of hours in a week.
  </p>

  <h2 id="night-overtime">Night Shifts and Night Overtime</h2>
  <p>
    Night shifts often cross midnight, which is why the calculator includes an “Ends next day”
    option. Night overtime is a classification of overtime that occurs during a night-time window
    (for example, 22:00 to 06:00). This calculator shows night overtime as hours only and does not
    calculate pay rates.
  </p>

  <h2>Breaks, Rounding, and Why Results Differ</h2>
  <p>
    Breaks and rounding policies can change totals even when shift times look the same. If your
    employer rounds time to the nearest 5, 10, or 15 minutes, choose the rounding option that
    matches your policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Calculates hours only, not pay, wages, or overtime rates</p>
  <p>Does not provide legal compliance guidance</p>
  <p>Subtracts unpaid breaks that you enter</p>
  <p>Uses your selected overtime rule and thresholds to split hours</p>
  <p>May not match an employer’s exact rounding rules unless you select the same rounding option</p>

  <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>What is the difference between regular hours and overtime hours?</strong></p>
    <p>Regular hours are counted up to your limit. Overtime hours are the remaining hours above that limit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Which overtime rule should I choose?</strong></p>
    <p>Use the rule that matches your timesheet policy. If you only have a weekly limit, choose Weekly. If you track overtime per day, choose Daily. If both are relevant, choose Daily + Weekly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>How does “Daily + Weekly” avoid double counting overtime?</strong></p>
    <p>The calculator computes daily overtime and weekly overtime, then uses the larger overtime result as the final overtime amount so overtime is counted once.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Can I calculate overtime for split shifts?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Split shifts add segments together for the day, subtract the break once, and then apply the overtime rule.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>What does “Ends next day” do?</strong></p>
    <p>It treats the end time as the next day so night shifts are counted correctly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>What is night overtime in this calculator?</strong></p>
    <p>Night overtime is a classification of overtime that occurs during your night window. It does not calculate pay rates.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Does this calculator round time the way my employer does?</strong></p>
    <p>It can. Choose the rounding option that matches your policy. If your employer uses a different rounding method, results may differ.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Can I set a custom week like Sunday–Saturday or Friday–Thursday?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Choose the week start day in weekly mode. The calculator treats the next 6 days as the rest of your week.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="overtime-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Does the calculator save my hours?</strong></p>
    <p>No. It runs in your browser and does not store your inputs.</p>

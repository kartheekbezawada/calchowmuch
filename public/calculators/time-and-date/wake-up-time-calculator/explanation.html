  <h2>What is a Wake-Up Time Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Wake-Up Time Calculator suggests the best times to wake up based on when you fall asleep. It aims to line up your wake-up time with the end of a sleep cycle, which can help reduce grogginess.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Wake-Up Time Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>
    Sleep typically happens in repeating cycles that average about 90 minutes. This calculator uses 90-minute cycles to estimate wake-up times after 4, 5, or 6 full cycles.
  </p>
  <p>• If you enter a fall-asleep time, it adds full cycles to suggest wake-up times.</p>
  <p>• If you enter a bedtime, it adds about 15 minutes first to estimate when you fall asleep, then adds full cycles.</p>

  <h2>Best Wake-Up Times (Examples)</h2>
  <p>
    If you fall asleep at 11:30 PM, your wake-up options are roughly 5:30 AM (4 cycles), 7:00 AM (5 cycles), or 8:30 AM (6 cycles).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you go to bed at 11:30 PM, the calculator first assumes you fall asleep around 11:45 PM, then shows wake-up options from there.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator uses averages:</p>
  <p>• Sleep cycle length is assumed to be 90 minutes (real cycles can vary).</p>
  <p>• Time to fall asleep is assumed to be 15 minutes when you enter a bedtime.</p>
  <p>
    Results are general estimates and are not medical advice. If you have persistent sleep problems, consider speaking with a healthcare professional.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="wake-faq-item">
    <p><strong>How many sleep cycles should I aim for?</strong></p>
    <p>Many adults feel best with 5–6 cycles (about 7.5–9 hours), but needs vary.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wake-faq-item">
    <p><strong>What is a sleep cycle?</strong></p>
    <p>A sleep cycle is a repeating pattern of light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep that often lasts about 90 minutes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wake-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Why does the calculator show multiple wake-up times?</strong></p>
    <p>It shows options for 4, 5, and 6 cycles so you can pick what fits your schedule.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wake-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Why might I still feel tired even if I wake up after full cycles?</strong></p>
    <p>Cycle length varies, and factors like stress, caffeine, irregular schedules, or sleep disorders can affect sleep quality.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wake-faq-item">
    <p><strong>Does the calculator account for naps or sleep debt?</strong></p>
    <p>No. It provides simple estimates based on typical cycles and does not model naps or long-term sleep patterns.</p>

  <h2>What is an Age Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    An Age Calculator tells you your exact age in years, months, and days based on your date of birth. It provides a precise, calendar-based age rather than an approximation.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Age Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>
    The calculator compares your date of birth with a selected comparison date (usually today). It counts full years first, then full months, and finally the remaining days, using real calendar month lengths.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>If your date of birth is 15 June 1990 and today is 1 September 2025, your age would be 35 years, 2 months, and 17 days.</p>
  <p>If you choose a different comparison date, the calculator shows your age as of that specific day.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Uses calendar dates, not average day counts</p>
  <p>Correctly handles leap years and varying month lengths</p>
  <p>Does not provide legal or official age verification</p>
  <p>
    Results are general calculations and should not be used where official documentation is required.
  </p>

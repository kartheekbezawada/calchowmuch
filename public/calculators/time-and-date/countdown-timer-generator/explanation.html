  <h2>What is a Countdown Timer Generator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Countdown Timer Generator tells you how much time is left until a specific date and time.
    It is useful for events, deadlines, launches, and personal milestones when you want a live
    countdown.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Countdown Timer Generator Works</h2>
  <p>
    The calculator compares your chosen target date and time with your current device time. It
    breaks the remaining time into days, hours, minutes, and seconds and updates the display
    every second.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>
    If it is 3:00 PM now and you set the target to 5:30 PM today, the countdown will show 2 hours
    and 30 minutes remaining.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you set the target to next week at 9:00 AM, the countdown will show the remaining days and
    hours until that date and time.
  </p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Uses your device time zone and clock</p>
  <p>Updates once per second for a live display</p>
  <p>Does not account for server time differences</p>
  <p>
    Results are general timing estimates and should not be used for legal or contractual deadlines.
  </p>

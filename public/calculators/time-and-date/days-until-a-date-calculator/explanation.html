  <h2>What is a Days Until a Date Calculator?</h2>
  <p>
    A Days Until a Date Calculator tells you how many days remain between today and a specific date. It's commonly used for counting down to events, deadlines, holidays, or personal milestones.
  </p>

  <h2>How This Days Until Calculator Works</h2>
  <p>
    The calculator compares today's date with the date you select and counts the number of full calendar days between them. It uses dates only, not hours or minutes, so the result stays consistent regardless of time of day.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>If today is 1 March and you select 15 March, the calculator shows 14 days until that date.</p>
  <p>If you select today's date, the result shows that the date is today.</p>
  <p>If you select a past date, the calculator shows how many days have passed since that date.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
  <p>This calculator:</p>
  <p>Uses your device's local date</p>
  <p>Counts calendar days only</p>
  <p>Does not include business days or holidays</p>
  <p>
    Results are general date calculations and should not be used for legal or contractual deadlines.

  <h2>Your Birthday Weekday (A Simple Calendar Fact)</h2>
  <p>
    Your date of birth is a real point in time on the calendar. This calculator tells you the day of
    the week that date falls on. For example, if you entered
    <span data-placeholder="dob">{DOB}</span>, you were born on
    <span data-placeholder="birth-weekday">{BIRTH_WEEKDAY}</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Your Birthday Falls on Different Weekdays</h2>
  <p>
    A year is not an exact number of whole weeks. Because of that, the weekday of a fixed date
    changes as years pass. Leap years add an extra day in February, which can shift weekdays
    differently over time.
  </p>

  <h2>Birthday Weekday in Another Year</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose a target year, the calculator tells you what weekday your birthday falls on in
    that year. For example, in <span data-placeholder="target-year">{TARGET_YEAR}</span> your
    birthday falls on <span data-placeholder="target-weekday">{TARGET_YEAR_WEEKDAY}</span>. This can
    help you plan parties, trips, or annual reminders.
  </p>
